Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, â€˜and what is the use of a book,â€™ thought Alice â€˜without pictures or conversations?â€™
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, â€˜Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!â€™ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled â€˜ORANGE MARMALADEâ€™, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
â€˜Well!â€™ thought Alice to herself, â€˜after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyâ€™ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldnâ€™t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!â€™ (Which was very likely true.)
Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! â€˜I wonder how many miles Iâ€™ve fallen by this time?â€™ she said aloud. â€˜I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I thinkâ€”â€™ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) â€˜â€”yes, thatâ€™s about the right distanceâ€”but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Iâ€™ve got to?â€™ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
Presently she began again. â€˜I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny itâ€™ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I thinkâ€”â€™ (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didnâ€™t sound at all the right word) â€˜â€”but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Maâ€™am, is this New Zealand or Australia?â€™ (and she tried to curtsey as she spokeâ€”fancy curtseying as youâ€™re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) â€˜And what an ignorant little girl sheâ€™ll think me for asking! No, itâ€™ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.â€™
Down, downlly bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked â€˜poison,â€™ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
However, this bottle was not marked â€˜poison,â€™ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *
â€˜What a curious feeling!â€™ said Alice; â€˜I must be shutting up like a telescope.â€™
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; â€˜for it might end, you know,â€™ said Alice to herself, â€˜in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?â€™ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
â€˜Come, thereâ€™s no use in crying like that!â€™ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; â€˜I advise you to leave off this minute!â€™ She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. â€˜But itâ€™s no use now,â€™ thought poor Alice, â€˜to pretend to be two people! Why, thereâ€™s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!â€™
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words â€˜EAT MEâ€™ were beautifully marked in currants. â€˜Well, Iâ€™ll eat it,â€™ said Alice, â€˜and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way Iâ€™ll get into the garden, and I donâ€™t care which happens!â€™
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, â€˜Which way? Which way?â€™, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears

â€˜Curiouser and curiouser!â€™ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); â€˜now Iâ€™m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!â€™ (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). â€˜Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? Iâ€™m sure I shanâ€™t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;â€”but I must be kind to them,â€™ thought Alice, â€˜or perhaps they wonâ€mind about it; if Iâ€™m Mabel, Iâ€™ll stay down here! Itâ€™ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying â€œCome up again, dear!â€ I shall only look up and say â€œWho am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, Iâ€™ll come up: if not, Iâ€™ll stay down here till Iâ€™m somebody elseâ€â€”but, oh dear!â€™ cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, â€˜I do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!â€™
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbitâ€™s little white kid gloves while she was talking. â€˜How can I have done that?â€™ she thought. â€˜I must be growing small again.â€™ She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
â€˜That was a narrow escape!â€™ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; â€˜and now for the garden!â€™ and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, â€˜and things are worse than ever,â€™ thought the poor child, â€˜for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare itâ€™s too bad, that it is!â€™
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, â€˜and in that case I can go back by railway,â€™ she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
â€˜I wish I hadnâ€™t cried so much!â€™ said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. â€˜I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.â€™
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
â€˜Would it be of any use, now,â€™ thought Alice, â€˜to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, thereâ€™s no harm in trying.â€™ So she began: â€˜O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!â€™ (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brotherâ€™s Latin Grammar, â€˜A mouseâ€”of a mouseâ€”to a mouseâ€”a mouseâ€”O mouse!â€™) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.
â€˜Perhaps it doesnâ€™t understand English,â€™ thought Alice; â€˜I daresay itâ€™s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.â€™ (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: â€˜Ou est ma chatte?â€™ which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. â€˜Oh, I beg your pardon!â€™ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animalâ€™s feelings. â€˜I quite forgot you didnâ€™t like cats.â€™
â€˜Not like cats!â€™ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. â€˜Would
